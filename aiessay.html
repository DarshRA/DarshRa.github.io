    <h1> How is Artificial Intelligence beneficial but</h1>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">  Artificial Intelligence is a system or machine that mimics human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on information they collect.  The purpose of the artificial Inteliggence is to make it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs, and perform human like tasks. There are four primary AI types: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware. Most robots nowadays from playing board games like chess to self-driving cars like tesla as they rely on heavy programming. We have Artificial Intelligence in our phones often known as Siri. While Artificial intelligence can be helpful to human beings, scientists warn it can alse be a threat to the public.  At the same time Artificial Intelligence can turn out bad if not coded properly. There has been lot of news about robots misbehaving due to an internal code error. Its like if self driving car has programming issue then everyone on the road can be in trouble. Artificial Intelligence can lead to unfair outcomes if not coded properly. I think the greatest challenges facing the Artificial Intelligence industry is the need  for large amounts of structures or standardized data with the human right to privacy.  Robots can't think or feel, despite what the researchers who build them what to believe. Artificial Intelligence can replace human in the future. AI can lead to impact on job market, since robots can do all the work. The idea that the quest for strong AI would ultimately lead to succeeding of AI tech. But at the same time AI is helpful for labor work. If we replace robots with the people doing the hard work It could be a little relief for those people. </p>
