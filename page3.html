    <h1>CS 1 Journey</h1>
    <p>Last year I took computer science with Mrs Jang. It was a fun and hard at the same time. First few assigments were easy and it became harder as we approched the course.    </p>

<br> </br>

    <p> At the end of last year we did a project called ISP. In this project we had to make a game using swift. At first we all that one question how and what to make? many of us changed our games because it was hard or needed much more time. Me and my friends first decided to make a game that was actually impossible. Then we came up with ping pong. It was easy and we already did that for the last assigments in CS1.

      <br> </br>

    <p> We were inspired by the real ping pong game. It took time to rebuild it so it would look diffrent than the assignment. We came up with some problems. The concept is simple, two people go against each other while hitting the ball back and forth on paddles until one person misses, giving the other person a point. Our ISP team feels this is a great concept as we would already have some experience on making pong games, and Pong is also a relatively fun game, especially when you can play against your friends. </p>


    <br> </br>

    <p> Our motivation for our ISP Project is to do our best in making the game, along with the code, and we also want people to enjoy the game. Pong had been a popular retro type games for many decades, and we believe that it is amazing how our ISP team can remake it and show it off to the class. </p>
